# Robot Droid Project

Welcome to the Robot Droid Project! This project aims to create an interactive droid inspired by popular robotic characters. The droid will serve as a personal assistant and a learning observer for a base AI system.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following directories and files:

- **docs/**: Contains documentation for both developers and end-users.
  - **developer/**: Detailed setup instructions for developers.
    - `setup_remote_desktop.md`: Instructions for setting up a remote desktop connection between the Raspberry Pi 5 and the development laptop.
  - **user/**: Simplified instructions for end-users.
    - `setup_remote_desktop.md`: User-friendly guidance for establishing a remote desktop connection.

- **src/**: Contains the source code for the project.
  - `main.py`: The main entry point for the application.
  - **communication/**: Handles communication protocols.
    - `pi_communication.py`: Functions for sending and receiving data.
  - **ai/**: Contains foundational AI logic.
    - `base_ai.py`: Classes and functions for processing data and making decisions.
  - **hardware/**: Interfaces with hardware components.
    - `raspberry_pi.py`: Functions for controlling GPIO pins and other hardware tasks.
  - **utils/**: Provides utility functions.
    - `helpers.py`: Common functions for data manipulation, logging, or configuration.

- `requirements.txt`: Lists the Python dependencies required for the project.

- `README.md`: Overview of the project, setup instructions, and contribution guidelines.
